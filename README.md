## Description

## Part I:
Create CI/CD workflow in GitHub Actions:

1. Create k8s cluster + private docker registry (Skip this step if already exists)

2. Create docker image (nginx web server + php-fpm with index.php inside) 
- You should be able to modify the content of index.php file

3. Upload the image to the docker registry.

4. Pull the image from the docker registry and deploy it to the kubernetes cluster.

5. For branch develop, the deploy is done automatically on pull request while for
branch master the deploy is done by running the workflow manually.
6. The workflow should output the applicationâ€™s service external ip.
Note: Make sure to hide sensitive data

### Processing

The project employs preprovisioned EKS cluster
Created EKS with terraform K8S_EKS_NAME = "eks-workshop"

> [!NOTE]
> _$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name eks-workshop --profile github-eks_



ADD SECRETS AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AND AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 

Create secret in EKS to store docker credentials:


kubectl create secret docker-registry regsecret \
--docker-server=docker.io \
--docker-username=vladbronfman \
--docker-password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
--docker-email=vlad.bronfman@gmail.com
secret/regsecret created

### TODO
1. The pipelines lakes test and validations
2. There are hardcoded values.
3. When considering the Kubernetes aspect, the pipeline lacks portability.
4. The folders tree ill-structured
