## Part I:
Create CI/CD workflow in GitHub Actions:

1. Create k8s cluster + private docker registry (Skip this step if already exists)
2. Create docker image (nginx web server + php-fpm with index.php inside)
- You should be able to modify the content of index.php file
3. Upload the image to the docker registry.
4. Pull the image from the docker registry and deploy it to the kubernetes cluster.
5. For branch develop, the deploy is done automatically on pull request while for
branch master the deploy is done by running the workflow manually.
6. The workflow should output the applicationâ€™s service external ip.
